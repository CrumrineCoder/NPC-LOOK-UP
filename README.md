# NPC lookup

A website for looking up NPCs for use in tabletop games. 

Plan: 
0) Login, need to be logged in to mae and edit a NPC
1) Build a form that has optinal fields except for the name. Able to submit it with the forms filled in and it be added to the database.
2) Ability to see the NPCs, search functionality like name:Nic, personality:quirky and it'll return whatever meets the most OR meets all of those conditions
3) The ability to add a comment to a NPC, such as how they used the NPC and how it turned out, or what they love about it. Upvote system? 
4) The user who created a NPC should be able to delete or edit its entry. 
5) How to do art hosting? Probably need to make this for github hosting instead of Glitch.
