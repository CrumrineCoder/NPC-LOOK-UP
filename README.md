# NPC Lookup

NPC Lookup is a website for storing Non-Playable-Characters (NPC) for tabletop games in a database. Users can browse these NPCs and comment on them. There is also a login system.

## To Do

* Resetting password and changing display name on the profile page. 
* Replying to comments and editing or deleting them on the NPC pages. If the user who created the NPC comments then there should be an indication
* Public profile pages if I want the NPCs to be more public and less anonymously made. 

## User Stories

User Story 1: I can see all NPCs by compact and then expand to see the full page if I'm interested. Users will be looking for the hook, the profession, the race, the gender, the age, the location, a quick insight into the personality, what type of faction they're in, and what their goals, beliefs, flaw and fears are.

User Story 2: I can create a NPC with the amount of detail I want and I can edit it at any time. User has to be logged in to create a NPC. I can also delete this entry. 

User Story 3: I can search for NPCs.
