Search functionality

User Story 1: I can see all NPCs by compact and then expand to see the full page if I'm interested. 
  Users will be looking for the hook, the profession, the race, the gender, the age, the location, a quick insight into the personality, what type of faction they're in, and what their goals, beliefs, flaw and fears are.
  
User Story 2: I can create a NPC with the amount of detail I want and I can edit it at any time. User has to be logged in to create a NPC. I can also delete this entry. 

User Story 3: I can search for NPCs by tags. I can remove these tags.
