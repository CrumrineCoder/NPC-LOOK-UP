# NPC Lookup

This is a full stack website that lets users create Non Playable Characters (NPCs) and add them to the database. Other users can view them and comment on them. Users can edit NPCs they've made and they only need to fill out the name. Users can also search for NPCs.

This was a personal project for an idea I had after looking at AdventureLookup and Undead.live. I refined the skills I learned making the Voting website by routing the individual pages better, incorporating Angular to display the data, experimenting with a comment section. Next steps are replying to comments, deleting and editing comments, and changing passwords.

## To Do

* Resetting password and changing display name on the profile page. 
* Replying to comments and editing or deleting them on the NPC pages. If the user who created the NPC comments then there should be an indication
* Public profile pages if I want the NPCs to be more public and less anonymously made. 
* User Guest accounts. 
* Pages for NPCs
* Sort by: 

## User Stories

User Story 1: I can see all NPCs by compact and then expand to see the full page if I'm interested. Users will be looking for the hook, the profession, the race, the gender, the age, the location, a quick insight into the personality, what type of faction they're in, and what their goals, beliefs, flaw and fears are.

User Story 2: I can create a NPC with the amount of detail I want and I can edit it at any time. User has to be logged in to create a NPC. I can also delete this entry. 

User Story 3: I can search for NPCs.
